        <h1>The Story of Vikram and Vetal</h1>
        <div class="story-container">
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a brave king named Vikramaditya. He was known far and wide for his wisdom and courage.</p>
            <p>One day, a sage asked King Vikram to capture a Vetal, a spirit that haunted a nearby forest. The sage explained that the Vetal was tricky and would often narrate a story and then ask a riddle.</p>
            <p>Vikram agreed and went to the forest. After a long and dangerous journey, he managed to capture the Vetal. As they were returning, the Vetal started narrating a story:</p>
            <p>"Once there were three friends, each with a unique talent. The first could run as fast as the wind, the second could fly like a bird, and the third could swim like a fish. They decided to have a race. Who won?"</p>
            <p>Vikram pondered for a moment and replied, "The one who can fly like a bird won because they could start on land, fly through the air, and finish in the water."</p>
            <p>As soon as Vikram answered the riddle, the Vetal escaped and returned to the forest.</p>
            <p>This happened many times, with the Vetal escaping after each story and riddle. Each time, Vikram had to capture it again. The stories were full of wisdom and lessons.</p>
            <p>And so, King Vikram continued his quest to capture the Vetal, and the cycle of stories and riddles continued, with each story teaching valuable lessons.</p>
