        <h1 class="text-center">Vikram and Vetal Story</h1>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in the ancient kingdom of Ujjain, there lived a wise and noble king named Vikramaditya. He was known for his courage and his commitment to justice. One day, a sage named Agastya presented the king with a unique challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agastya gave the king a magical throne and instructed him to sit on it at midnight in a cremation ground. He also told the king that during his journey to the cremation ground, he would encounter a corpse inhabited by a Vetal, a restless spirit. Vikramaditya was tasked with bringing the Vetal to the sage without uttering a word. If he spoke, the Vetal would return to its resting place, and the king would have to start again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vikramaditya accepted the challenge and embarked on his journey to the cremation ground. As he reached the ground at midnight, he saw a corpse hanging from a tree. He decided to carry the corpse on his shoulder and began walking towards Agastya's ashram.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way, the Vetal inside the corpse started to speak. It told the king a series of captivating stories, each with a moral lesson. Vikramaditya listened attentively but remained silent. The stories were so intriguing that he forgot about his vow of silence and spoke to correct the Vetal's narration.
        </p>
        <p>
            With each word the king spoke, the Vetal flew back to its tree and the corpse returned to its hanging position. Vikramaditya had to retrieve the corpse each time and continue the journey. This cycle repeated 24 times, with 24 different stories and lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, after many trials and tribulations, Vikramaditya successfully brought the Vetal to Agastya. The sage was pleased and revealed that the purpose of the challenge was to teach the king valuable lessons in patience, wisdom, and the consequences of breaking a vow.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that day on, Vikramaditya's fame as a wise and just ruler spread far and wide, and he continued to rule his kingdom with honor and integrity.
