        <h1>The Story of Vikram and Vetal</h1>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there lived a wise and fearless king named Vikram. He was known for his valor and intelligence. One night, as he was walking through a dark forest, he encountered a strange entity known as Vetal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vetal was a mischievous spirit who loved to tell stories. He proposed a challenge to King Vikram. He said, "I will tell you a story, but only if you promise to listen without interrupting. If you interrupt, I will fly back to my abode."
        </p>
        <p>
            King Vikram agreed, and Vetal began to narrate captivating stories, each with a moral lesson. But after every story, Vikram couldn't resist asking questions, and each time Vetal flew back to his abode, leaving Vikram to bring him back.
